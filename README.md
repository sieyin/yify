# Simple YIFY
**A simple and lightweight GUI to the YIFY API**

A single HTML file with some CSS and JavaScript, that fetches a JSON file from the [YIFY API](https://yts.mx/api) and renders a responsive webpage with the last items released and search functionality, so you don't have to deal with the adware of the original site. ~~It also streams the torrent via [Webtor](https://github.com/webtor-io/embed-sdk-js) or [hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/).~~

You can see it at work here â†’ [https://sieyin.github.io/yify/](https://sieyin.github.io/yify/)
